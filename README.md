# Overview and Origin:

## ***What if the future of banking wasn’t a bank?*** 
### *Almost everything we do has been made better with technology, so why hasn’t the way we manage our money?*

Incorportaed in 2019, Neo Financial was built on the premise that Canadians have been underserved in their finances for far too long. After building SkipTheDishes into a top 10 brand in Canada, they are now set on challenging conventions with a smarter spending, saving and rewards experience for Canadians.

# Funding
Neo Financial has raised a total of $235.8M in funding over 6 rounds. Their seed round of funding was held on March 1, 2019 and their latest funding was raised on May 5, 2022 from a Series C round. Neo Financial is funded by 18 investors. Valar Ventures and FJ Labs are the most recent investors. 

Neo has achieved unicorn status, or a valuation of over $1 billion. Also participating in the series C round were Tribe Capital, Altos Ventures, Blank Ventures, Gaingels, Maple VC and Knollwood Advisory.

# Business Activities
According to a very recent survey held by Manulife Bank, most Canadians (87%) believe we will soon enter a recession or are already in one, majority (56%) think that it will last at least a year, and nearly two-thirds (62%) say they don't feel prepared financially for a recession. Only 8% of Canadians state they're adjusting their financial plan, and only 5% are adjusting their debt re-payment plan. It would not be wrong to say that financial planning is a dire need for Canadians to help them manage their everyday finances appropriately.

Neo Financial is a technology company re-imagining spending, savings and rewards by using technology to simplify finances, create rewarding experiences and build community for all Canadians.
Neo has developed a very user friendly app to help their customers track their spending habits and gain valuable insights into their everyday purchases. 

With Neo Financial, the team has successfully launched a rewards-driven minimal viable product (MVP) with a credit card and a savings account to test the market. The team is focusing on user behaviour, capturing user feedback, and iteratively adding more related services. 

Neo Financial is challenging Canada’s big five banks by reimagining the customer experience of banking. Trusted by 1 million customers already in a short span of 3 years since incorporation, Neo's target customer is everyone who uses their smartphone for everyday banking purposes. 
It is imperative to understand that Neo is not a bank. It has partnered with Saskatoon-based Concentra Bank to offer savings accounts, and with ATB Financial, owned by the Alberta provincial government, for credit card issuance.

The top 5 banks in Canada control 93% of the market share but none of them offer the perks that Neo offers to its customers. They truly believe in providing Canadians with the best possible solutions so that they can help empower them financially. Neo offers a hybrid savings and chequing account that it hopes customers will treat as their primary account.The account pays 1.30% interest, which is 130 times higher than the rate paid by the big five banks. Not only that, the company also offers Canada's highest interest savings account with no annual fees, no minimum balance requirements, and 2.25% interest rate. 

The digital-only Neo Savings account offers many features of a current account, including unlimited free transactions and no monthly fees or minimum balance requirements. Offering a debit card with ATM access was not a priority for Neo in their initial phase because most Canadians use Credit cards for spending and pay it off using their bank accounts. 
Neo plans on offering loans, mortgages, and investment products to its customers in the near future. They also plan on introducing mobile cheque deposits shortly along with offering a debit card with ATM access.
