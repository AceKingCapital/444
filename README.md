# Business Activities
According to a very recent survey held by Manulife Bank, most Canadians (87%) believe we will soon enter a recession or are already in one, majority (56%) think that it will last at least a year, and nearly two-thirds (62%) say they don't feel prepared financially for a recession. Only 8% of Canadians state they're adjusting their financial plan, and only 5% are adjusting their debt re-payment plan. It would not be wrong to say that financial planning is a dire need for Canadians to help them manage their finances appropriately.

Neo Financial is a technology company re-imagining spending, savings and rewards by using technology to simplify finances, create rewarding experiences and build community for all Canadians.
Neo has developed a very user friendly app to help their customers track their spending habits and gain valuable insights into their everyday purchases. 

With Neo Financial, the team has successfully launched a rewards-driven minimal viable product (MVP) with a credit card and a savings account to test the market. The team is focusing on user behaviour, capturing user feedback, and iteratively adding more related services. 

Neo partners with over 7,000 partners across the country to help businesses acquire new customers, drive incremental sales, and sustain customer loyalty.
